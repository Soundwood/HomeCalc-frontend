            <h2>30% Rule Home Purchase Analysis</h2> 
            <h4>This rule states that no more than 30% of Gross Income should be used for 
                all housing costs (including mortgage, interest and property tax). This is also considered a US government standard.
                 Spending more than this means you are considered "housing-cost burdened" by the US Government</h4>
            <h4>Based on this rule we suggest the following:</h4>
            <p>
                Monthly expenses should not exceed: {"$"+props.formatMoney(max)}<br/>
                Monthly Mortgage Interest: {"$"+props.formatMoney(mortg_int)} (This will go DOWN over the life of the loan)<br/>
                Monthly Mortgage Principal: {"$"+props.formatMoney(mortg_princ)} (This will go UP over the life of the loan)<br/>
                Monthly Total Mortgage: {"$"+props.formatMoney(mortg)}<br/>
                Assumed Annual State and Local Property Taxes: {tax_rate*100+"%"}<br/>
                Monthly Property Tax: {"$"+props.formatMoney(prop_tax)}<br/>
                <strong>Monthly Total Mortgage and Tax: {"$"+props.formatMoney(mortg_and_tax)}</strong><br/>
                <strong>Max Home Purchase Price: {"$"+props.formatMoney(htcost)}</strong>
            </p>
            <h4>Other costs to consider: <br/>
            PMI, Homeowner's Insurance, HOA Fees, Utilities Costs (Water, Electric, Gas)</h4>
