            <h2>Ramsey Rule Home Purchase Analysis</h2> 
            <h4>This rule (popularized by Dave Ramsey) states that no more than 25% of Take Home (after tax) Income should be used for 
                all housing costs (including mortgage, interest and property tax). It also requires a 15 year mortgage and a 10% downpayment.</h4>
            <h4>Based on this rule we suggest the following:</h4>
            <p>
                Monthly expenses should not exceed: {"$"+props.formatMoney(max)}<br/>
                Monthly Mortgage Interest: {"$"+props.formatMoney(mortg_int)} (This will go DOWN over the life of the loan)<br/>
                Monthly Mortgage Principal: {"$"+props.formatMoney(mortg_princ)} (This will go UP over the life of the loan)<br/>
                Monthly Total Mortgage: {"$"+props.formatMoney(mortg)}<br/>
                Assumed Annual Tax Rate for this State: {tax_rate*100+"%"}<br/>
                Monthly Property Tax: {"$"+props.formatMoney(prop_tax)}<br/>
                <strong>Monthly Total Mortgage and Tax: {"$"+props.formatMoney(max)}</strong><br/>
                <strong>Max Home Purchase Price: {"$"+props.formatMoney(htcost)}</strong>
            </p>
            <h4>Other costs to consider: <br/>
            PMI, Homeowner's Insurance, HOA Fees, Utilities Costs (Water, Electric, Gas)</h4>
        </>
